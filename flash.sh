#!/usr/bin/env bash
# flash.sh — interactive USB-serial port picker for `pio run -t upload`.
#
# Why this exists: many shack ESP boards ship with Silicon Labs CP2102
# USB-serial chips, all with the same factory-locked default serial
# number "0001". Both macOS and Linux can only disambiguate them by
# enumeration order, so a hard-coded `upload_port` in platformio.ini
# silently targets the wrong board whenever two CP2102 devices are
# plugged in at once. This script lists the visible USB-serial devices
# and asks which one to flash.
#
# CP2102 EEPROM reprogramming was investigated in the sibling
# esp8266-gps-ntp project on 2026-05-12 — on the locked stock NodeMCU
# and ESP32 dev-board chips, vendor-OUT control transfers return
# success but the EEPROM is not actually written, so a per-board
# unique serial number is not achievable in software.
